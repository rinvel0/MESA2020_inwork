Project
===============================================================================
The GPY211 is a Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) Ethernet Network Connection device
with one Ethernet PHY, supporting speeds of 10, 100, 1000 and 2500 Mbps.
It also supports a four-speed (10/100/1000/2500 Mbps) SGMII interface for
connecting with an external chip.
